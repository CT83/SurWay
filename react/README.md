# Sur-Way

First I got the basic html form working

Then I added Material UI

Created a basic template structure for the project so things won't be repeated

Now let's fix up the header. 

Now, that is done 

Decided to revert from Material UI to plain React till I figure it out completely

Then moved on to creating the node js backend
